# Deforestation Detection - Week 1

This repository contains the Week 1 milestone deliverables for the **AICTE-Edunet-Shell Internship Program** on Green Skills using AI technologies.

## üî• Project Overview

The goal of this project is to detect and classify different fire types across India using MODIS Satellite Data from the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. This data analysis forms the basis for further deforestation detection and monitoring.

## ‚úÖ Week 1 Work Completed

- Imported and merged MODIS satellite data for 2021, 2022, and 2023.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data:
  - Removed duplicates
  - Dropped unnecessary columns
  - Encoded categorical columns (e.g. confidence levels)
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including:
  - Fire Type distribution
  - Fire Radiative Power (FRP) distribution
  - Confidence Level distribution (bar and pie charts)
- Saved a cleaned dataset for model building in Week 2.
